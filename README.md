# Medical-Chatbot

A sophisticated medical information retrieval system powered by LLaMA 2 (7B) that leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) architecture to provide accurate medical information.

## 🌟 Features

- **Advanced Language Model**: Utilizes Meta's LLaMA 2 (7B parameters) for natural and contextual responses
- **RAG Architecture**: Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accurate and source-based responses
- **Vector Database**: Employs Pinecone for efficient similarity search and retrieval
- **Dual Interface**:
  - RESTful API built with FastAPI for seamless integration
  - User-friendly web interface for direct interactions
- **Extensible Knowledge Base**: Medical literature database that can be easily updated and scaled

## 🚀 Technical Stack

- **Language Model**: LLaMA 2 (7B) - HuggingFace Implementation
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI
- **Vector Database**: Pinecone
- **Knowledge Base**: Curated medical literature and textbooks
- **API**: RESTful endpoints for programmatic access

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Query Processing**: User inputs are processed and vectorized
2. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Relevant medical information is retrieved from Pinecone
3. **Context Enhancement**: Retrieved information augments the LLaMA 2 model's knowledge
4. **Response Generation**: Model generates accurate, context-aware responses
